    <h2>Water Reminder</h2>
    <p>Did you drink your water?</p>
    <p>
      Remember, staying hydrated is important for your health. It helps regulate
      body temperature, keep joints lubricated, prevent infections, deliver
      nutrients to cells, and keep organs functioning properly. Being
      well-hydrated also improves sleep quality, cognition, and mood.
